This is a project to develop some example scripts in Perl (and possibly other languages later) that demonstrates some useful techniques in working with the utf-8 stored as USASCII7 in Voyager's Oracle database.

On my machine I'm using an instant client driver setup, more details on that later.  I'm also using strawberry perl.  

Setup:

All the options for the scripts are kept in a file called db.conf.  I'll get a skeleton file set up soon, but I wanted to get something up.  It's a Config::General file, following the pattern...

VoyDriver = 
VoyUser = 	
VoyPass = 
VoyServer = 
VoyDatabase = 
VoyDBQ = 


GoogleDBdriver     = 				 
GoogleDBserver     = 		 
GoogleDB           =

At some point I'll set up a stub file and make sure my git ignore file is set up correctly.

The later stanza is only needed if you're running some of the scripts that demonstrate inserting into SQL Server.

(I need to clean up some of the scripts so that they each are an example of doing one thing, with some of the less important details put into a module. I want to get what I've done out though, as it's likely
